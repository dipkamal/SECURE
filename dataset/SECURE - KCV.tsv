This is done by iterating over all chunks (all\nthe filters with the same priority) in the region and in each chunk\niterating over all the filters.\n\nWhen the work runs out of credits it stores the current chunk and entry\nas markers in the per-work context so that it would know where to resume\nthe migration from the next time the work is scheduled.\n\nUpon error, the chunk marker is reset to NULL, but without resetting the\nentry markers despite being relative to it. This can result in migration\nbeing resumed from an entry that does not belong to the chunk being\nmigrated. In turn, this will eventually lead to a chunk being iterated\nover as if it is an entry. Because of how the two structures happen to\nbe defined, this does not lead to KASAN splats, but to warnings such as\n[1].\n\nFix by creating a helper that resets all the markers and call it from\nall the places the currently only reset the chunk marker. For good\nmeasures also call it when starting a completely new rehash. Add a\nwarning to avoid future cases.\n\n[1]\nWARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 1076 at drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/core_acl_flex_keys.c:407 mlxsw_afk_encode+0x242/0x2f0\nModules linked in:\nCPU: 7 PID: 1076 Comm: kworker/7:24 Tainted: G        W          6.9.0-rc3-custom-00880-g29e61d91b77b #29\nHardware name: Mellanox Technologies Ltd.
